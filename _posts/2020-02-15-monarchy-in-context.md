# Introduction

Traditional Catholic circles debate over the return of monarchy in governance. Monarchists claim increased centralization, stability in power, and better upbringing for rulers. Anti-monarchists, whether republican or otherwise, cite abuses committed by early-modern monarchs against Church rule. These points falter when considering the entire historical context of monarchy, being a system that underwent variations in theory and practice.

# The Fall of Rome

The vassal-beneficiary system prevalent in the Middle Ages originated from Roman patronage systems and Germanic social bonds. Wealthy Romans would grant physical and financial protection to clients in exchange for services rendered. Despite its hierarchical nature, both parties had stringent obligations to each other. Being unable to fulfill such would cause the relationship to crumble. Similarly, Germanic chieftains had a _comitatus_ of loyal retainers who would serve him in battle or administration. With the Western Roman Empire declining, the imperial government proved unable to protect or sustain its citizens in far-off territories. Locals would turn to nearby aristocrats and patricians for protection and sustenance. This practice already persisted with Limitanei border guards working the land under a _dux_ while not on campaign.
